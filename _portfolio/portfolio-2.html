During the 2025 spring break at UC Berkeley, I heard from my teacher that QIP2025 will be held at Durham, Duke University. I have been interested in quantum computing for a long time, so I decided to register and attend the conference. This is my first time attending an academic conference, and I am very excited! Although I did not present any paper, I learned a lot from the talks and posters presented by other researchers. I also had the opportunity to meet some experts in the field and discuss with them. Overall, it was a great experience and I hope to attend more conferences in the future (with my own markable academic achievement)!
